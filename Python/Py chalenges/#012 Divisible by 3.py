# Divisible by 3

# Define a function named div_3 that returns True if its single integer parameter is divisible by 3 and False otherwise.

# For example, div_3(6) is True because 6/3 does not leave any remainder. However div_3(5) is False because 5/3 leaves 2 as a remainder.

def div_3(num):
    return num % 3 == 0
